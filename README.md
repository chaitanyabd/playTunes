[Web based PlayTunes tool to help you create and test out your Arduino ToneMelody before flashing it!](https://infinitybeam.io/playtune.html)

If you've used the Arduino ToneMelodies you know how hard it can be to test out a tune. Will you keep flashing it with minor updates until your tune is perfected? Now you don't need to - just go to https://infinitybeam.io/playtune.html and you can try out your own tunes. 

If you've made an awesome ToneMelody tune and you want me to feature it, please write to me on cd@infinitybeam.io and I'll be happy to feature it on the "playtune.html" page with a backlink to your site!

This is the ideal ToneMelody Tester tool to save you time and effort while trying out your next big awesome thing for the Arduino!

Devices supported:
1. All devices that can work through the Arduino Tone Melody interface
2. I personally use it on ESP8266 and ESP32 devices - works well!
