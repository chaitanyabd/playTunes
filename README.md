# playTunes
Web based PlayTunes tool to help you create and test out your Arduino ToneMelody before flashing it!

If you've used the Arduino ToneMelodies you know how hard it can be to test out a tune. Will you keep flashing it with minor updates until your tune is perfected? Now you don't need to - just go to https://infinitybeam.io/playtune.html and you can try out your own tunes. 

If you've made an awesome ToneMelody tune and you want me to feature it, please write to me on cd@infinitybeam.io and I'll be happy to feature it on the "playtune.html" page with a backlink to your site!

This is the ideal ToneMelody Tester tool to save you time and effort while trying out your next big awesome thing for the Arduino!

Devices supported:
1. All devices that can work through the Arduino Tone Melody interface
2. I personally use it on ESP8266 and ESP32 devices - works well!
